Welcome to the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org/) JavaScript SDK. This library aims to make viewing and verifying
[C2PA](https://c2pa.org/) metadata in the browser as easy as possible. It is set up as a monorepo comprised of the following libraries
intended for client use:

- **c2pa** is the main package that is used for loading and verifying C2PA data. This runs all of the processing
  logic on the client using a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) module and exposes a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-compatible API for easy integration.
- **c2pa-wc** provides UI components designed with input from the C2PA UX working group. It is meant to
  allow users to get up and running with standard UI patterns quickly and easily in any front end environment.
- **@contentauth/react-hooks** provides a hooks interface for React components to quickly get provenance and thumbnail data
  in your React app.

Additionally, we have a couple supporting libraries that are utilized by the ones above, and _not_ intended for mainstream use:

- **@cai/toolkit** houses the WebAssembly module, data binding functions, and related build tools. `c2pa` consumes
  this library under the hood. The WebAssembly module handles all parsing, validation, and
- **@cai/detector** provides a high-performance binary scanner to quickly detect if C2PA metadata exists in a file.
  It is used to determine whether to download a file for further processing. This library is also brought in via `c2pa`.

To learn how to use these libraries, please consult the [Quick start](quick-start) page.

## Features

### Developer friendly

Our library aims to make integration a developer-friendly experience, with comprehensive documentation,
robust debugging (utilitizing the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) library), and full TypeScript support.

### Performance

The processing code of this library uses a high-performance WebAssembly binary. Additionally, processing tasks are
offloaded to a configurable Web Worker pool to enable parallelization and discourage blocking of your web application's
main thread.

### Lazy loading and processing

Since images can be quite large, our library tries to inspect the start of the file for C2PA metadata before the entire
asset is requested, [if the server supports it](../guides/hosting#range-requests). The rest of the image will only be downloaded if
the metadata marker is found. Additionally, we delay loading of the WebAssembly binary until the first processing request is made.

### Adherence to the C2PA specification

We strive to maintain compliance with the [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html) as much as possible, and
our web components follow the [C2PA user experience guidance](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/ux/UX_Recommendations.html) recommendations.

### Security and encryption

The SDK handles all [validation](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validation)
via the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) and any validation errors are passed back to the client.

### Framework-agnostic

Our UI components are created as [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) using the [Lit library](https://lit.dev/).
Because of this, they can be used in [React, Vue, Angular, Svelte](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/), or even vanilla JavaScript.
