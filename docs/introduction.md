illustrates the different concepts mentioned in this page.

### Terms

These definitions expand on the relevant terms in the [glossary](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_glossary)
found in the [C2PA 1.0 Technical Specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/index.html).

#### C2PA Manifest

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_manifest):

> The set of information about the provenance of an asset based on the combination of one or more assertions (including
> content bindings), a single _claim_, and a _claim signature_. A _C2PA Manifest_ is part of a _C2PA Manifest Store_.

#### C2PA Manifest Store

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_manifest_store):

> A collection of _C2PA Manifests_ that can either be embedded into an asset or be external to its _asset_.

#### Active Manifest

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_active_manifest):

> The last manifest in the list of _C2PA Manifests_ inside of a _C2PA Manifest Store_ which is the one with the set of _content bindings_ that are able to be validated.

#### Asset

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_asset):

> A file or stream of data containing _digital content_, asset metadata and optionally, a _C2PA Manifest_.

#### Composed asset

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_composed_asset):

> A composed asset is an _asset_ that is created by building up a collection of multiple parts or fragments of [_digital content_](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_digital_content) (referred to as ingredients) from one or more other _assets_.

For example, this can be an image (image A) where another image (image B) is imported and super-imposed on top of the starting image. In this
example, image B would be referred to as an _ingredient_.

#### Assertion

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_assertion):

> A data structure which represents a statement asserted by an _actor_ concerning the _asset_. This data is a part of the _C2PA Manifest_.
