title: Getting a signing certificate

:::warning Important
Best practices for handling keys and certificates are beyond the scope of this documentation.  Always protect your private keys with the highest level of security; for example, never share them through insecure channels such as email.
:::

To sign manifest claims, you must have an X.509 v3 security certificate and key that conform to the requirements laid out in the [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#x509_certificates). Additionally, the C2PA program provides a [Certificate Policy](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/docs/current/C2PA%20Certificate%20Policy.pdf) containing the requirements for a certification authority (CA) to follow when issuing C2PA claim signing certificates and the requirements for the use of such certificates.


## Purchasing a certificate

:::note
The [C2PA conformance program](https://c2pa.org/conformance/) establishes the requirements governing the issuance of C2PA claim signing certificates for use by product developers.  Through the end of 2025 you can still purchase a certificate from any CA and request to add it to the [interim trust list](trust-list.mdx), but starting in 2026 conforming generator products must use a certificate from a CA on the C2PA trust list.  See [C2PA conformance program](conformance.mdx) for more information.
:::

The process to purchase a certificate and key is different for each CA: You might be able to simply click a "Buy" button on the CA's website. Or your can make your own key and use it to create a certificate signing request (CSR) that you send to the CA. Regardless of the process, what you get back is a signed certificate that you use to create a certificate chain.

The certificate chain starts with the certificate from the last tool that signed the manifest (known as the "end-entity") followed by the certificate that signed it, and so on, back to the original CA issuer. This enables a validating application to determine that the manifest is valid because the certificate chain goes back to a trusted root certificate authority.

### Types of certificates

The C2PA specification requires that an "end entity" signing certificate must be either:

- An S/MIME email certificate (`id-kp-emailProtection` EKU). This is usually the simplest and least expensive option.
- A document signing certificate (`id-kp-documentSigning` EKU). Obtaining these kinds of certificates typically have more stringent requirements (like proving your identity) and costs more.

For more details, see [Certificate requirements](#certificate-requirements) below.

### Certificate authorities (CAs)

You must purchase a signing certificate from a certificate authority (CA).  The following table provides some links to popular CAs for convenience. This information is for reference only; inclusion does not imply endorsement by CAI or Adobe, Inc.

| CA | S/MIME email signing | Document signing |
|----|----------------------|------------------|
| Digicert | [S/MIME email signing](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/secure-email-smime-certificates) | [Document signing](https://www.digicert.com/signing/document-signing-certificates) |
| GlobalSign | [S/MIME email signing](https://shop.globalsign.com/en/secure-email) | [Document signing](https://shop.globalsign.com/en/document-signing) |
| IdenTrust | [S/MIME email signing](https://www.identrust.com/digital-certificates/secure-email-smime) | [Document signing](https://www.identrust.com/digital-certificates/document-signing) |
| Sectigo | [S/MIME email signing](https://ssl.comodoca.com/s-mime) | [Document signing](https://ssl.comodoca.com/document-signing-certificates) |
| SSL.com | [S/MIME email signing](https://www.ssl.com/certificates/s-mime-certificates/) | [Document signing](https://www.ssl.com/certificates/document-signing-certificates/) |

### Certificate signing requests (CSRs)

A CSR is just an unsigned certificate that's a template for the certificate that you're requesting. The CA creates a new certificate with the parameters specified in the CSR, and signs it with their root certificate, which makes it a valid certificate.

A CSR comprises a public key, as well as ["distinguished name" information](https://knowledge.digicert.com/general-information/what-is-a-distinguished-name) that identifies the individual or organization requesting the certificate. The distinguished name includes a common name, organization, city, state, country, and e-mail address. Not all of these fields are required and will vary depending with the assurance level of the desired certificate.

:::tip
For the C2PA [Verify tool](https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/) to display your organization name in the Content Credentials, your CSR must include the "O" or Organization Name attribute in the distinguished name information. 
:::

You sign the CSR with your private key; this proves to the CA that you have control of the private key that corresponds to the public key included in the CSR. Once the requested information in a CSR passes a vetting process and domain control is established, the CA may sign the public key to indicate that it can be publicly trusted.

## Certificate requirements

:::note
The information in this section is superseded by the [C2PA certificate policy](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/docs/current/C2PA%20Certificate%20Policy.pdf) the that establishes the requirements governing the issuance of C2PA claim signing certificates.  
:::

A signing certificate and key (credentials) must conform to the requirements in the [C2PA specification X.509 Certificates section](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#x509_certificates); specifically, it must:

- Follow the public key infrastructure (PKI) X.509 V3 specification.
- Have the Key Usage (KU) extension, which must be marked as critical. 
- Assert the `digitalSignature` bit.
- Have the Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension. If the Basic Constraints extension is absent or the certificate authority (CA) Boolean is not asserted, the EKU must be non-empty.
  - The `anyExtendedKeyUsageEKU` field (2.5.29.37.0) must not be present.
  - If the configuration store does not contain a list of EKUs, a certificate that signs C2PA manifests must be valid for the `id-kp-emailProtection` (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4) purpose and/or the `id-kp-documentSigning` (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.36) purpose.

### Extended key usage (EKU) fields

You must select at least one of the extended key usage (EKU) fields that specify what the certificate can be used for: **email protection** and **document signing**. Applications that use the CAI SDK won't accept the certificate unless it has one of these EKUs.

### Organization name

If you want the C2PA [Verify tool](https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/) to display your organization name in the Content Credentials, your certificate must include the "O" or [Organization Name attribute](https://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/2.5.4.10.html) (OID value 2.5.4.10) in the distinguished name information. The CA may require some validation steps to prove you are part of that organization (details vary by CA).

### Signature types

The following table describes the signature algorithms and types that the CAI SDK supports. You must supply credentials (certificates and keys) that correspond to the signing algorithm (`signatureAlgorithm`). Signing/validation will fail if the the supplied credentials don't support the signature type.

This table is provided for convenience, and is based on information in the [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#x509_certificates). The specification is authoritative; refer to it for more details.  The C2PA specification also covers two other certificates for timestamp responses and OCSP certificate revocation, which are not covered here.
