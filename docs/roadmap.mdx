title: Open-source SDK task planning and roadmap
hide_table_of_contents: true
---

This is an overview of task planning for the CAI open-source SDK to provide a general idea of priorities and progress. The roadmap is subject to change based on feedback and other factors.

:::note
This information was updated in **May, 2025**. It will be regularly updated but might not always reflect the most current status.
:::

Tasks in progress or planning are categorized as follows (in reverse order of completion):

- [**Released**](#released) : The feature, code, or fix has been released.
- [**Merged to Main**](#merged-to-main): Code has been merged to the main branch but not yet released.
- [**Code Complete**](#code-complete): Coding is done, but testing may still be in progress, and the task has not been merged to the main branch.
- [**In Progress**](#in-progress): Work is in progress.
- [**To Do**](#todo): Planned for future work.
- [**In Review / Triage**](#in-review--triage): Task is under review to determine if and when it can be addressed.

A new issue/task starts in the **In Review / Triage** status. Once reviewed and approved, it moves into **To Do** status, and when a developer begins working on it, into **In Progress**. Once development work is done, the task moves to **Code Complete**. After testing and validation, it moves to **Merged to Main**, which is the final step before it is included in a release.
