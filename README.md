on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Installation

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Deployments are handled automatically by Netlify. Please open up a pull request with any changes and a preview site
should be created automatically so that the preview can be shared before merging.
